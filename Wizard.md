# Wizard

A wizard was a person capable of drawing mana from life around the them to perform magic. Not everybody was capable of utilizing magic, some couldn't at all, others had their bodies destroyed by the process, and those who could withstand it had to monitor their internal organs to ensure no damage. Mastery of magic gave one the power to alter their own biology - most remarkably they could heal the damage caused by aging and become functionally immortal. In the Age of Magic wizards were fairly common place, leading to massive changes in the environment and destruction around them until The Magi War led to the Great Collapse. In a Age of Regrowth, only those on the Council of Wizards were allowed to perform magic. It was founded twelve surviving wizards from the Age of Magic, and had strict acceptance criteria as such that only a few beyond that age were ever accepted in and trained in their ways. Eventually Kalstroy, the Necromancer, would gain control of the wizard, and lead the Domonian Invasion that would cause the Age of Dominion. I am thinking the main character of my Age of Regrowth story is an illegal wizard 

## History

##### Age of Monsters

The age of monsters is punctuated by a period of dominion over the world by giant monsters and killer plants. The world was hostile, and largely inhospitable to humans who survived as nomads and scavengers, avoiding danger at all cost, never making any technological advances. The legend goes that Dante, the first wizard, discovered he could manipulate fire, and used fire balls to kill ravenous dire wolves that would have trampled his tribe. Dante would pass this knowledge on until fire manipulation would become common knowledge. Dante, never became more powerful than that and would live a natural life span.
