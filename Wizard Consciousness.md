Wizards have the ability to switch consciousness, due to their long lives. Each consciousness can only be filled with 90 years of experience before they start to become corrupted. When they grow a new consciousness, they will usually fill it up with 20 years of the previous consciousness so they don't start from scratch. They can revert to old consciousnesses when the situation calls for it, but this exerts a lot of energy and will require a full day of meditation. be
