[[Goblin]]s are humanoids who stand at about 2 to 4 feet; have brown, grey or silver bodies covered in head to toe in warts, and black eyes that can see in the dark. They were originally a human kingdom who hoarded silver in the mountain mines of [[Gyzer]] until they were cursed by a wizard for their greed. He cursed the silver in these mines with magic, and the people of Gyzer became addicted to its consumption. They could only eat pure refined silver, and so they quite literally consumed their own wealth. A social hierarchy formed between those who were allowed to consume the silver, typically silver coloured skin and those who weren't in order to preserve what was left of their wealth. Those who were denied silver were driven insane and became Feral Goblins driven mad by bloodlust. No longer could silver placate them, and they wandered the country side on a rampage. Pretty much all the native humans were slaughtered or turned into slaves. The southern islands were unreachable by the Feral goblins who had no knowledge of seafaring, so those islands became divided into city-states. Eventually, the feral goblins consumed until there was nothing left in the region to consumed. They ate their slaves until they had no more slaves. They consumed the grass. They ate all the trees. Some had gone north but were no match for the armies northbound. Eventually all the feral goblins died out, leaving behind only the Gyzer goblin who continued to subsist on the silver in their mines but it had began to make them docile and they lost knowledge of mining, refining and crafts. Eventually they became practically mindless creatures. The legend goes that the founding fathers of [[Asimi (City-state)]] were banished from their kingdoms for trying to stage a coup against their kings and install a democracy. These wandering vagabonds left to die came upon the Gyzer mountains, found the harmless docile Goblins there who were still consuming their slowly depleting stores of silver treasures. The vagabonds seized control over their treasures and enslaved the goblins. They could succeed because the silver made them docile and eager to please whomever fed them. Eventually they discovered the abandoned silver mines of Gyzer and put the goblins to work in there, and they eventually put them to work else where. I am still trying to figure out what the vagabonds would have been eating this whole time since the land is baren at this point, but eventually this leads to the founding of [[Asimi]], the mountain city state, eventually they would create silver coins from the silver mines that became a fundamental part of the world's economy. They would trade for food stuff, though they also could do a little farming as well. Eventually they would trade off some of the goblins along with silver to other regions leading to the goblins spread across the continent. [[Asimi]] silver from the Gyzer mountains is the only silver enthused with that magic the goblins find so addictive, thus it becomes one of the most valuable resource since it allows people to control the goblins. And once you have goblins in your employ its essential to keep them fed with Asimi silver lest they become feral. [[Asimi]] was also able to figure out how
