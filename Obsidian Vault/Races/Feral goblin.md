# Feral Goblins

Feral goblins were typically [[Docile goblin]]s who were deprived of [[Spiced silver]], subjected to violence or gained a taste for flesh. Their leathery skin would turn from it's silver sheen to colours ranging from brown to orange, and they would gain a bloodlust. These feral goblins will consume the animals around them, including humans, until there was no more to consume and then they themselves would starve to death. As such, feral goblins did not reproduce.  

These goblins are most famous for the [[Great Butchering of Tholosia]]. 

## Appearance 

A goblin's height could  range from 80 to 100cm, and their weight ranged from about 12-18kg. Their heads were typically round shaped, with giant bulging black eyes, small slits for their noses, and rather thin lips on their giant mouths. The skin of a feral goblin was leathery, covered in swollen warts and boils, and ranged from brown to orange. They had no hair, bot even eyebrows, making their expression difficult to read aside from a crazed, ravenous stare. Their teeth was sharp like an alligator, design to rip through flesh. Their finger nails were thick and claw like. These goblins wore whatever armor and welded whatever weapons they picked up from the humans they killed. They were skinny, lanky, malnourished. Their hands were coarse and calloused and due to their crooked backs often hunched over.
