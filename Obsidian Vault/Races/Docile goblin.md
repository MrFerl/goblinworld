# Docile Goblins


Docile goblins were humanoids cursed to always crave [[Spiced silver]], a magically infused metal found only in the mountains of [[Gyzer]]. To the goblins, spiced silver was an extremely addictive drug that clouded their mind and made them highly servient to anyone who offered it to them. The metal could be consumed once it has been refined, and the composition had to be at least 90% spiced-silver. For a docile goblin, as long as they could consume spiced-silver, they were okay to subsist on a diet of mushrooms and insects. However, if they were denied spiced silver for too long, they would turn into [[Feral goblin]]s with a taste for flesh, be it human or otherwise. 

The docile goblins were notable for being majorly under the control of the [[Asimi (City-state)]], whom put them to work in the mines of Gyzer. The [[Asimi]] then refined this silver, and made into valuable coins (see: [[Asimi coin]]). These coins were valuable as currency due to its use in goblin ownership as they were fed to the Docile goblins in exchange for their servitude.

A goblin's height could  range from 80 to 100cm, and their weight ranged from about 12-18kg. Their heads were typically round shaped, with giant bulging black eyes, small slits for their noses, and rather thin lips on their giant mouths. Their skin was silver, and seemingly reflected light like the moon, although it often went grey and dull as they aged. Up close, one would notice their skin was dry and thick, almost exactly like leather, and covered head to toe in terrible warts and boils which would only increase in number, and become dreadfully swollen with age. These creatures have almost no hair. They didn't even have eyebrows, which often made it difficult to read their emotions. Their teeth were sharp like an alligator, but in their old age would go yellow and brittle and fall out as a side effect of spiced silver. Their finger nails were thick and claw like. 



###### Miner goblin

><font size=1>Goblin in the mines</font>

Miner goblins were typically  skinny and malnourished due to their extremely limited diet, combined with their brutal-life style. Their hands were coarse and calloused, and constantly peeling. Their claw-like nails would break easily, leaving behind jagged ends like broken glass. Their backs were crooked, and they were constantly hunched back when not powering away with a pickaxe. 


###### Well fed goblins
Some owners took great care of their goblins, and these would maintain their silver glow into old age, and would be have more fat on their bones. In fact, some would even get quite pudgy, appearing almost like a fat cat on two legs. Some people would dress them up in cute clothes for children. 


## History

###### Tholosian Origins

Goblins descend from Tholosian humans. The Tholosia was a fairly advance civilization for its age due to the stockpiles of mana they found deep beneath this earth. Mana was used to power their incredible machinery that practically automated manual labor, and it was able to make fertile soil in a land that wheat could not group. Unfortunately, mana was also an hallucinogenic, and the kingdom had a severe trouble with addiction. This detail can be expanded upon later. But over the years the mana stores depleted, and the Tholosian working class who were heavily entrenched in this drug, went wild and feral. They went on a blood hungry rebellion, overthrowing the king, but it didn't stop their, for their bloodlust could not be contained, they went on a rampage known as the [[Great Butchering of Tholosia]]. A wizard emerged to solve this problem, and his solution was to place a spell on the mountain of Gyzer, to turn all of its treasures and all of its mines into [[Spiced silver]]. The cannibals were drawn to the Gyzer mountains, and then sealed away, where over centuries they transformed into the Docile goblins we know today. 

###### Discovery by the Asimi

Lydorus Asimi was the nephew of a northern king who was banished for attempting to stage a coup that would instate democracy instead of monarchy. Lydororus traveled the world as a stranger every where he went, making ends meet as a mercenary, until one day he discovered a map of the Gyzer mountains, and a secret entrance left unsealed by the wizard. Lydororus would soon put together a small team, and they would inflitrate the mountains, originally expecting to find it abandoned and full of treasure. However, they found the Docile goblins instead, and the remaining treasure almost completely consumed. The men Lydororus hired completely turned against him, stealing what they could of the mountains treasure and sealing Lydorous to die. Lydorous however, lived there for a few years subsisting on mushrooms and insects, and would eventually figure out that if he withheld the silver treasure from the goblins, and then drip fed it to them, they would do whatever he asked for him. And so, Lydorous put them to work, and together they undid the seal placed upon the mountains by the wizard. 

The details are still being figured out, but Lydorous would eventually found the city now known as Asimi at the Gyzer mountain, and form its economy around the servitude of the goblins.

## Personality 

Docile goblins tended to be dazed with a perpetual brain fog that made it difficult for them to follow overly complex instructions. They were, however, eager to please if kept on a steady dose of spiced silver and would carry all instructions as best as they could understand. Even if their interpretation is wrong or doesn't make logical sense. Even if asked to carry out violence, they will do it happily, but the act will turn them feral. They look pertude most of the time but will sometimes lend a smile to their owners. 

# Babies

When a baby goblin is born the mother is usually allowed to take a break for one month to look after it. Usually the mother will feed them spiced silver young thus the generational cycle of spiced silver addiction continues. Presumably if a goblin is never exposed to spiced silver in this way they may never suffer the effects of brain fog nor will they go feral. Typically the baby is then given the "matron goblin". 

## Eunuch Goblin

The Asimi city state maintained a mastery over goblins with full awareness that they are both their greatest assets but also their greatest threat. They trade them into slavery to other nations but only male eunuchs. If they traded away a goblin capable of breeding, other nations could do goblin breeding which would both devalue them as an economic resource but also increases the possibility that they would have to deal with a feral outbreak from another land.
