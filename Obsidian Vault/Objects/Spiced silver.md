# Spiced Silver 

Spiced silver is the name given to the silver found in the Gyzer that has been refined enough for goblin consumption. It contains a magical substance called mana that is a hallucinogen and extremely addictive. It makes the goblins docile and servient, and without it they would turn feral. Hypothetically if a new born goblin is never exposed to spiced silver they may never become docile or feral, but this is unlikely to happen.
